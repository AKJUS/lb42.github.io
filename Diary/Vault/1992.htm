<h2>Life with Me: 1992</h2>

<p><i>There seems to be a point of view prevalent amongst the other
inhabitants of Burnard Towers to the effect that I am never there, but
spend all my time gadding around foreign locations and not always
remembering to bring daughters nice presents back from them to
boot. In order to lay at least some of these indecent speculations to
bed once for all, this year I have taken the trouble of checking back
through the disorganized mass of scribbles and ticket stubs and
expense claims to come up with the following AUTHORITATIVE LIST of my
foreign engagements during 1992.</i></p>

<p><b>JANUARY</b> 3-10th. To Chicago for a few days editorial work and
thence to Las Cruces for a three day workshop at the University of New
Mexico's famed Center for Research in Linguistics run by Yorick Wilks.

<p>22-30th: To Pisa for a pair of workshops, this time at the even
more famed (and culinarily far superior) Inst. di Linguistica
Compazionale; the first one had large numbers of large cheeses, and
the second a smaller number of grease monkeys. Michael and I had to
work at both.
<p><b>FEBRUARY</b> I stayed in Oxford, apart from a couple of day trips to London

<p><b>MARCH</b> 1 -3 : to New Brunswick, home of Johnson &amp; Johnson,
for a TEI Steering Committee Meeting. I stayed at the Hyatt and the
meeting was in Rutgers University, but in three days you don't see
much of either.  
<p> Rest of month and all of <b>APRIL</b> I stayed in Oxford
(though, admittedly, somewhat pre-occupied by the ALLCACH 92
conference which I had got lumbered with the organization of. It was
in Christ Church and there were about 250 attendees to worry about.)

<p><b>MAY</b> 25th: To Chicago for another TEI Steering Committee
meeting, followed by a three day meeting of the Technical Review Committee. I stayed with Michael,
which meant a lot of suburban commuting from Oak Park.

<p>In <b>JUNE</b> I note a couple of domestic engagements: only one (in
Lancaster) involving an over night stay, this time in a really posh
British hotel. And I did my share of baby sitting while Lilette wound
up to her degree ceremony.

<p><b>JULY</b> 11th: Another weekend in the wilds of New Jersey: this
time I think we stayed in a Best Western hotel nowhere in particular
called Scotch Plains, and met at Susan Hockey's house. It's hard to
tell.  
<p>24th: To Nantes for COLING 92. I taught a half day workshop on
TEI matters, the reward for which was four days in a nice hotel, lots
of sunshine and no obligation to go to any boring sessions about
computational linguistics. And I went to the seaside. This one was
definitely more pleasure than business.

<p><b>AUGUST </b>
28th: To <a href="9208bologna.txt">Bologna</a> 
for the Association for History and Computing's annual
conference, for which my friend Digger and I had a paper, most of
which we prepared at Guy's mountain retreat in Vergato, in
the intervals of helping Guy fight forest fires. And we didn't stay in
Bologna very long, it must be admitted. Too hot. Then on to Pisa and
 <!--a href="9209paris.htm"-->to <a target="reports:collected.xml#Report-1992-09-12"> Paris</a> for a couple of day's consultation each with various corpus
builders. Hey, this is what the TEI is paying me for, right?

<p><b>SEPTEMBER</b> 18-20: To Bergen for the only real TEI workgroup
meeting of the year. A real pleasure to spend two days at the
Wittgenstein Archive arguing about how to encode manuscripts with
assorted manuscript encoders. And only one afternoon sight-seeing (I
saw Grieg's grave and learned he was Scots. Did you know that?)

<p><b>OCTOBER</b> 15-16 : Two days in Bonn at another corpus
workshop. This was politically a good idea, but intellectually fairly
pointless since my knowledge of German has not advanced much beyond
the 'can i have a cup of coffee' stage. I spent a lot of time
whispering to the helpful lady next to me.

<p>21-24: To Bologna again, definitely for holiday purposes, paid for by
my giving a childs' introduction to things electronic at a conference
organized by something called the Association for Italian Teachers of
English, in Parma, where I met a different bunch of people and eat
very well indeed.  Guy and I took a leisurely route back, involving a
visit to a very strange place called Sabionetta.

<p><b>NOVEMBER</b> 27-9: The third transatlantic weekend necessitated
by a TEI Steering Committee Meeting; this time we stayed in a Best
Western hotel in Bernardsville New Jersey and met in Don Walker's
house, but only the names seemed to be different. I had a nice day
before the meeting wandering around Manhattan with Joe Raben
however.

<p><b>DECEMBER</b>
 7-9 As a birthday treat, I took Lilette to Paris with me. Then I went
to a two day workshop on HyTime (a new ISO standard forthe encoding of
time based hypermedia, since you ask).

<p>I think this summary proves conclusively that there have been as many
as six weeks at a time when I have not stirred from Oxford. And no
month in which I have been away for more than two weeks. So I am sure
you will agree that rumours of my non-existence are seriously
over-stated. Moreover, I have learned a great deal from all this
foreign travel, if only where to eat well in several European cities
(and that it is simply not possible to eat well in any American
city). And I can now announce my OFFICIAL HONOURS LIST for 1992 as
follows: 
<ol>
<li>Best Transatlantic Carrier: Air India. The food is
interesting and the movies are amazing. Runner up: Virgin Atlantic
(movies also pretty good, but food less impressive) 
<li>Most Memorable
Lunch: Osteria 36, Parma. (four hours of unalloyed pleasure and five
courses) 
<li>Most Ridiculous Venue: La Cantina, Old Las Cruces (a
lovingly restored 19th c. bordello now masquerading as a Mexican
restaurant) 
<li>Most Bizarre Historical Sight: the town of Sabionetta,
where nothing much has happened since the 15th century 
<li>Most
Impressive Railway Station: the Musee d'Orsay, Paris (runner up:
Hoboken Rail/Ferry Terminal, terminus of the the first electric
railway in the US ran, driven by Edison himself, and from which there
is a magnificent view of Manhattan) 
<li>Best Musical Debut: a difficult
choice, what with Sarah's performances at the Dome and the Old Fire
Station, but I think on balance the opportunities for low comedy
offered by her role as the Mad Hatter in Alice ...
