         One of the reasons I don’t much like Medium as a medium for my important autobiographical jottings is that I can’t work in the editing environment I use for everything else, i.e. TEI XML. And all the usual ones about having to lock my stuff away in a proprietary format I can’t control, of course. So, as 2021 closed down shop, I started making efforts to move over to straight and simple TEI-based files, rendered with CETEICEAN.
