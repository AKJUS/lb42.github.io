To be honest, I didn't apply for a job here; I applied for one in Fiji, but whatever remnant of empire was responsible for recruiting to commonwealth universities offered me this one instead. It was tropical, it was a job. I took it. </p><p>With the job came my first proper flat and my first car, and indeed my first personal servant unless you count Oxford scouts. His name was Jim Kandiado and he looked after me, and (in due course) Lilette very well. </p><p>The flat was on the ground floor of a modern block, just over the road from the Kamuzu Stadium, on the Makata road. and it looked like this: </p><div class="figure"><img src="../media/19720000_chichiri.png" alt="" class="graphic" style=" width:600px;"></img></div><p>I lived here for an eventful year, coming to terms with the strangeness of being a <span class="foreign">mzungu</span>, and an academic to boot. The beautiful Mauritian girl who moved in with me helped a lot. After a year the University moved to Zomba, and so therefore did we. This photo shows the huge University lorry which came to move us:</p><div class="figure"><img src="../media/1973-chichiri-movingout-03019.jpg" alt="" class="graphic" style=" width:600px;"></img></div><p>Our new home was much more traditional. In fact, I dont even think it had an address. It was one of a small number of European Bungalows built along the Old Naisi Road in the days when the Colonial Government occupied Zomba. With independence, the government had moved to somewhere else, leaving behind some rather fine antique housing stock for expats like me and my fellow academics to snap up. </p><div class="figure"><img src="../media/1973-chilwa-04021.jpg" alt="" class="graphic" style=" width:600px;"></img></div><p>From the garden of our bungalow (which had all sorts of fruit trees) you could see Lake Chirwa on a clear day. There was a village built of mud huts within walking distance and wild pigs in the surrounding gardens. I learned how to to drive around the Zomba plateau at dangerous speeds so as to get to the Zomba Gymkhana Club in time for the ham sandwich which Lilette was inexplicably craving. Belinda was born here. </p></div><div class="slide"><h2>Hello Belinda!</h2><div class="figure"><img src="../media/19731111_belinda.jpg" alt="" class="graphic" style=" width:700px;"></img></div><ul><li class="item">Zomba, 11 Nov 1973</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h2>1974: Back to Europe</h2><p>We delayed as long as possible the business of finding a post-Malawian residence by visiting friends and families on an extended European tour, courtesy of the flexible air ticket which I got as a returning expat.
