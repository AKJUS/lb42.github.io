# ODD
This repo provides web access to some whiskery old tutorials about the TEI's wonderful ODD system, which used to be on the official TEI site, but are no longer. The actual documents are stored in a different github repo which used to be (but is not currently) visible at (https://github.com/TEIC/Documents) : this one is for the HTML view of them.
