                <p>Some boxes have been unpacked, and it's possible to live in Clifton Park Road.
                    But I have committments on the continent to enjoy, during these dying days of
                    free movement. So with a nod from Mr Maneki-Neko, I abandoned Lilette to do more
                    box work, and took the bus to Temple Meads, whence by Great Western and too many
                    underground trains (top tip, which I had forgotten, there are two underground
                    stations at Paddington: choosing the wrong one condemns you to an extra tedious
                    interchange at Edgware Road) via Liverpool Street and the Central Line to
                    far-flung Stratford, arriving in time for tea, which I took in the horrible
                    coffee bar at the station exit, taking the opportunity to recharge my phone so
                    that I could let Elizabeth and Daphne know grand-pere was in town. </p>
                <p>It's only a short walk from Stratford station to their house, and worth the
                    effort. </p>

                <head>14 September: London to Munich</head>
                <p>An early start next morning, since the plan is to get the 1100 Eurostar
                    departure. Armed with my special spar-preise DB ticket von London nach Munchen
                    (price 129.90), I head back to Stratford International, so-called, even though
                    no international train has ever stopped here; nor are they likely to any time
                    soon, alas. The sun shines none the less, and the streetscape has its
                    moments:</p>

                </figure>
                <p>A commuter train from the wilds of East Anglia deposits me at St Pancras, and I
                    make my way through the usual processing to the Business Lounge, probably for
                    the last time for a while, since my carte blanche membership expires next month.
                    Farewell to free coffee, free nibbles, and (in Paris) free cocktails. Farewell
                    to a spot of calm before the journey and the sensation of being a member of a
                    bourgeois elite; I am no longer worthy, and unlikely to become so again any time
                    soon. The number of agencies willing to shell out for my train trips to France
                    is much reduced. Ah well, it was nice while it lasted. </p>

                <p>But no matter, it's time for me and the hoards to board ES9126, the 1110
                    departure for Brussells. My reserved seat in the very end of the train. </p>

                    <head>The tail end of my Eurostar</head>
                </figure>
                <p>The journey across Kent, under the channel, across Northern France, and into
                    Belgium is, of course, utterly unremarkable, just as we like it, and we pull
                    into Brussels Midi on time at 1405. At which point I discover that my promised
                    onward connexion to Munich has already left, half an hour earlier than
                    timetabled when I booked it. I remonstrate with a patient person in the Belgian
                    ticket office, who passes me on to a patient person in the German ticket office.
                    Neither of them can do anything practical other than propose a revised itinerary
                    which, with the best will in the world, will get me into Munich two hours later
                    than planned, precluding a pleasant Bavarian evening dinner. I therefore proceed
                    out of the station into the street and seek some pleasant lunch instead, so as
                    to make better use of the yawning two hour chasm into which the anticipated
                    modest 25 minute connexion time has transformed itself. </p>
                <p>At least the train I am now catching is also retimed for engineering works. Off
                    we go to Frankfurt on board ICE 215, retimed but otherwise as reliable and
                    comfortable as ever. At Frankfurt I change onto another ICE train, heading south
                    to München. And so to the Ibis Munchen City, chosen mainly for its proximity to
                    the station, though the fact that they always give me a free drink on arrival
                    may also have encouraged me. And a good night's sleep, fuelled by fizzy
                    lager.</p>
                <!-- My epic journey to #teiconf2019 hit its first bump... Brussels to Frankfurt trains 
                    retimed for engineering works, so that  what would have been a nice 25 min connexion 
                    id now a yawning 120 mins chasm. Oh well. Time for lunch.-->
                <!--                Now on board ice 215 to Frankfurt which also left 30 mins early.

                <head>15 September : Munich to Graz </head>
                <p>Next morning, I dilly-dally over a German breakfast, check out, and walk back to
                    the station in a leisurely manner. Which was a mistake, since my onward train to
                    Graz (the 1017 departure) has been retimed to leave 30 minutes earlier than
                    expected, i.e. just as I was strolling into the station. Curses. I remonstrate
                    further with a DB person, who seems strangely unmoved. My ticket is endorsed
                    with the splendid phrase "zugbindung aufgehoben" and I am advised to proceed via
                    the 1203 to Bischofshofen, where I can get a connexion to Graz. However, the
                    prospect of hanging around at Munch station for two hours on a boring Sunday
                    morning when the db lounge is closed does not appeal, so I re-assert control of
                    my destiny and plot a slightly different route than they propose even though it
                    won't get me to Graz any sooner. I get a metro ticket to Munich OstBahnhof,
                    where I catch the 1138 to Salzburg, enjoy a 20 minute pause for refreshment, (an
                    abstemious glass of mineral water on a sunny terrace) and then proceed on to
                    Bischofshofen, at which place, hard though it it is to spell, I will have a
                    connexion to EC163, the famous Transalpin express, a train with its own entry in
                    Wikipedia, and a mega-scenic route across the alps, which is particularly nice
                    since my re-ticketting has placed me in the first class carriage with huge
                    observational windows. The sun is shining and the alpine scenery is indeed
                    exceptionally, well, scenic. </p>
                <p>I arrive into Graz at 18h22, precisely two hours later than expected, and take a
                    taxi to my AirBNB, located in a pedestrian street the other side of the park
                    which separates Karl Franzen's magnificent University from the rest of the city.
                    Ah Austria: how civilised. My residence for the next week is a bed-sit five
                    minutes walk from the Uni, next door to a Chinese restaurant, and handy for the
                    Spar, as well as assorted restaurants. </p>

                <head>Sept 16 - 19 : Graz</head>
                <p>The TEI Conference 2019 duly unfolds, with or without my attention. I confess to
                    feeling somewhat alienated or excluded, though that is, of course, my own
                    choice. After all this time the TEI has to be able to get by without me very
                    well, after all and therefore by extension, I without it. I went to one side
                    meeting of the TEI Council where the long standing question of how to introduce
                    Standoff markup without totally screwing up the existing architecture was
                    thrashed out, or churned about, or generally pondered. I went to some good
                    sessions and some less good. The weather behaved impeccably and the sandwiches
                    were irreproachable, not to mention the tasty packets of wafer biscuits. </p>

                </figure>
                <p> The opening plenary was notable because Jan suggested that TEI might possibly
                    have something to offer statistically minded distant readers or stylometricians
                    or whatever they are called this week. However, nobody seemed to take this very
                    seriously, nor did I ever find anyone who wanted to go out for dinner with me. I
                    spent many evenings arguing fruitlessly with the appalling telephone banking
                    service offered by Santander. On the whole, and in retrospect, it was a rather
                    depressing week.</p>

                <head>September 21 : Graz - Szombethaly</head>
                <p>Casting off the dust of academic conferences, I took the 1108 departure from Graz
                    down to the Hungarian border, and a station called <ref
                        target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szentgotth%C3%A1rd"
                        >Szentgotthárd</ref>, possibly the same saint as he of the pass, possibly
                    not. In any case, this was a most agreeable journey, chuntering through the
                    mountains and forests of lower Styria, with their gingerbread-style cottages,
                    rural farmyards, fields of maize and pumpkins mostly now harvested for the
                    winter. The train follows the route of a river, which I am mildly amused to
                    learn is known as the Raab. </p>
                <p>At Saint Gotthard, I transfer to a waiting Hungarian train, which is a restful
                    green colour. We're not in Styria anymore. The train continues down the river
                    valley to the nearest town, which rejoices in the name of Szombethaly, about
                    which I know nothing, except that it was the birthplace of (a) Saint Martin,
                    according to ancient medieval tradition and (b) Leo Bloom's father, according to
                    James Joyce. Arriving at 1915 I have time to admire a rather fine baroque
                    station, and to wander down a main street clearly reconstructed quite recently,
                    before checking into my allegedly boutique hotel at ?. Bags dumped, I sally
                    forth in search of dinner. But who is this familiar figure, turning his head to
                    greet me half way down the main drag? How very conceptual. Dinner is decidedly
                    Hungarian, being goulash and noodles, to the accompaniment of loud and very
                    annoying light music. </p>
                <!--
Sep 21
Today's train is a little cutie... 1108 from Graz to the Hungarian border. Saint Gothard (a différent one) here we come!
                Now trundling through forests and mountains with gingerbread cottages to match. 
                Principal crops round here seem to be maize and pumpkins
                The last hour or so has been pootling along the valley of the raab .. but googlemaps now tells me we have crossed the Styrian border
                We're definitely not in Styria any more. The trains are green and people talk funny.

            <div type="slide">
                <head>September 22: Szombethaly - Budapest</head>
                <p>I do have a little time to explore Szombethaly next morning, and the sun is
                    shining in an attempt to encourage me. But honesty compels me to say that, well,
                    it appears to be thriving on EU laissez-faire, and looks superficially like most
                    other cities of this size across the continent. I didn't have time to check out
                    St Martin's birthplace because it was located on the wrong side of the dual
                    carriage way I was walking along towards the station. </p>
                <p>Opposite the station, which I reached far too early, is the usual row of somewhat
                    depressed snack bars and cafes, with a view over some strange sculpture and a
                    seemingly abandoned bicycle. I had a coffee and wondered why for a while before
                    soldiering on to catch the ? to Budapest, a train with first class coaches that
                    boasted real compartments and slightly tired red plush seats. But onward, and
                    hoorah for Budapest Keleti station which boasts the biggest information screen I
                    have seen for a while. <figure>
                        <graphic url="../media/20190922_135852.jpg"/>
                    </figure> My phone beeps imperiously and lo, it is Carolin who has just arrived
                    at her hotel and wants to start plotting our ELTeC course forthwith. My phone
                    battery and signal are both failing, but I manage to find out where I am
                    supposed to meet her and scurry down to the wonderful Hungarian metro.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="slide">
                <head>September 23 - 24: Budapest </head>
                <p>I am staying in a rather posh hotel on the umpteenth floor, commanding splendid
                    views of what is probably a major traffic intersection, since I can see a bus
                    station and a metro entrance as well as shoals of taxis all flowing beneath me.
                    But duty calls, so off I trot to eat a light lunch and try to agree a plan of
                    campaign for the next few days. </p>
                <p>The University buildings are a short walk away and a little less splendid than
                    the ones in Graz, but built on a similar scale, with lots of staircases and
                    grand corridors opening onto high ceilinged slightly grubby lecture halls. The
                    gig is a <ref target="https://github.com/distantreading/WG1/wiki/TS-Budapest"
                        >COST Training Workshop</ref> on how to prepare texts for ELTeC, presented
                    jointly with Martina Scholger from Graz and Christian Reul from Wurzburg but
                    sadly no-one else much, since the training session is scheduled to run in
                    parallel with the COST Workgroups, and indeed in parallel with other training
                    sessions. I am mildly peeved about this, since it means I don't get to argue
                    with anyone about corpus design or encoding decisions but also mildly relieved
                    since it means whatever the decisions (if any) are, it won't be my fault. <figure>

                    </figure> Anyway, the timetable is agreed, the materials are all more or less in
                    place, and about a dozen people have turned up, including a couple of brainy
                    Hungarians (one of them sporting James Cummings style socks with toes), a bloke
                    in a yarmulka, and a lost Italian. Over the next three days Martina brings
                    everyone up to speed, more or less, on oXygen and TEI basics while I put in a
                    very brief appearance at a Management Committee meeting; Christian introduces
                    OCR4ALL ; and then I drive them through three prepared exercises: firstly using
                    the magic of regexp to introduce basic tagging into some entirely markup-free
                    Polish texts from Maciej; secondly using the magic of xslt (and oXygen) to do
                    the same for some texts which have been saved in an Abbyy XML format, as tweaked
                    by Christian; and thirdly, ditto ditto for some common or garden Word DOCX
                    files. At some point during all this, there was also a plenary from visiting
                    australian celeb K Bode, which I found almost entirely unintelligible. Anyway, a
                    few new ELTeC novels were finally produced, and the two brainy Hungarians at
                    least clearly enjoyed themselves, but by the end of the second day I was ready
                    to run away again, which indeed I did during the penultimate coffee break, on
                    the grounds that I had a flight to catch. </p>

                <head>September 25: Budapest - Paris - Caen</head>
                <p>So, abandoning my principles in the interests of economy and previous
                    committment, here I am being processed for another tedious Ryanair flight, this
                    time from Budapest to Paris CDG, which should arrive in time for me to zip
                    across to Paris Montmartre and catch the last train to Caen. Which,
                    astonishingly, it does. Being kettled repeatedly at Budapest airport before
                    boarding is less horrible than it might have been since I have paid extra to get
                    a seat at the front of the plane; the long walk across CDG from terminal ? to
                    the RER station was no worse than usual; the RER train was no fuller of low life
                    and american tourists than usual; and the intercite to Caen was actually on
                    time. Caen station, or rather its entrance, seems to have moved since I was last
                    there, but I still contrive to get myself to the Hotel du Chateau and
                    collapse.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="slide">
                <head>September 26: Caen </head>
                <p>I am here for the annual meeting of the Conseil Scientifique of the Maison de la
                    Recherche, a fixture not to be missed in my calendar (I think the first I attended was in May 2012: see 
                    <ptr target="https://foxglove.hypotheses.org/352"/>).

                    This little group of aged sages has after all this time coalesced into a
                    community of sorts which I am proud to feel a part of.  And we are always treated
                    to a feast of intellectual stimulation as well as some excellent dinners, some
                    insight into the politics of the establishment as well as some intelligent
                    conversation over lunch, not to mention the agreeable sensation of being valued,
                    a heady mixture which Pascal Buleon is a past master in administering. This year
                    we were introduced to Metope, the latest all singing all dancing TEI-based
                    publishing framework from PUCC, which I rather enjoyed. </p>
                <p>We dined this year in the Caen Chateau, which to my enormous pleasure has recently acquired 
                    a large statue apparently named Lou. 
                    <figure><graphic url="../media/20190926_201615.jpg"/></figure>      
                </p>
                <p>I was also planning to enjoy the journey back to Bristol, which I had planned to
                    take in a TER to ?, a boat to Jersey, and a hedge-hopping flight from there. But
                    stormy seas in the Manche meant that my ferry wasn't going to sail, which in
                    turn meant I had to reorganize my return entirely, cutting short my time in
                    Caen. On the plus side, I got to ride back to Paris on a proper train; on the
                    minus side I had to return to stinky old Paris CDG for an Easyjet to Bristol.
                    Oh well. </p>
