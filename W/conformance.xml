            <head>What is TEI conformance? </head>
            <p>This little document is an attempt to explain as clearly as possible what we mean
               when we say that a document is <soCalled>TEI conformant</soCalled>. As such, it
               duplicates to some extent <ref
                  target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/USE.html">an existing
                  chapter of the TEI Guidelines</ref>. The reason for producing it is to attempt to
               establish a consensus about the changes which need to be made in the wording of that
               chapter, following a number of issues raised on the TEI Issue Tracker (see for example <ptr
                  target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1586 https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1587"/>)
                  </p>
            <p>It seems helpful to begin with a little picture: <figure>
                  <graphic url="media/oddflavours.png"/>
               </figure></p>
            <p>Each of the blobs here represents three subtly different things: <list>
                  <item>an ODD : that is, a collection of TEI specifications</item>
                  <item>a formal schema generated from that ODD, and its natural language
                     documentation</item>
                  <item>the set of documents considered valid by that schema</item>
               </list></p>
            <p>The TEI provides tei_all : a set of over 500 uniquely identifiable elements, classes,
               attributes, etc. and a schema in which they are all permitted. For all practical
               purposes a user of the TEI must make a selection from this cornucopia, and we call
               that selection a <term>TEI subset</term>. Of course there are many many possible TEI
               subsets, each making different choices of elements or attributes or classes, but the
               sets of documents which each consequent schema will validate all have in common that
               they will also be considered valid by the schema tei_all. </p>
            <p>A user of the TEI may however do more than simply choose a subset of the provided
               specifications. They may also provide additional constraints for aspects of an
               encoding left underspecified by the TEI, for example by requiring that attribute
               values be taken from a closed list of possible values rather than being any
               syntactically valid token. They may change the datatype of an attribute, for example
               from a string to an integer or a date. They may provide an alternative identifier for
               an element or an attribute, for example to change its canonical English name for one
               from another language. They may change the content model of an element, for example
               so that child elements may appear in an order different from that specified by the
               TEI. They may change the class memberships of an existing TEI element, for example so
               that it gains attributes not expected by the existing element, or so that it may
               appear in different contexts.</p>
            <p> In some cases, these modifications result in a schema which continues to regard as
               valid a subset of the documents considered valid by tei_all. In others this is not
               the case. Renaming operations, for example, cannot ever result in a subset: a
               document in which the element names have all been changed to their French equivalents
               cannot be validated by an English language version of tei_all. A change to the
               content model or the class memberships of existing TEI elements may or may not be
               equivalent to a subsetting operation. For example, if the order of child elements
               within some element is changed from unspecified to specified, the resulting schema
               will still be a subset of tei_all; the reverse is not the case, as some documents
               considered valid by the new schema will be considered invalid by tei_all. </p>
            <p> We use the term <term>customised subset</term> for all these kinds of
               personalisation because they result in something which is not necessarily a further
               subset of the TEI subset concerned, but a further modification of it. In the general
               case, their conformance with tei_all can be determined only by inspection, and their
               validation may require some additional processing.</p>
            <p>Finally, a user of the TEI is at liberty to define entirely new elements and
               attributes, and to make such components members of existing TEI classes so that
               existing TEI elements may refer to them. They may also modify the content models of
               existing TEI elements to refer explicitly to such new elements. This results in an
                  <term>extended subset</term>, since it contains elements or attributes additional
               to those provided by the tei_all schema. Such additional components should always be
               labelled as belonging to a non-TEI namespace. A processor can then determine that
               these components may be left out of consideration when determining the validity of a
               document with respect to tei_all.</p>
            <p>In additional to these formal considerations, TEI conformance involves attention to
               some less easily verifiable constraints, specifically the twin requirements of
                  <term>honesty</term> and <term>explicitness</term>. By honesty we mean that
               elements in the TEI namespace must respect the semantics which the TEI Guidelines
               supply as a part of their definition. By explicitness we mean that all modifications
               (i.e. both customized and extended subsets) should be expressed using an ODD to
               document exactly how the TEI declarations on which they are based have been derived.
               (An ODD need not of course be based on the TEI at all, but in that case the question
               of TEI conformance does not arise)</p>
            <p>Formally speaking, we can say of a document that it is <term>TEI conformant</term> if
               : <list>
                  <item>it is a well formed XML document; and </item>
                  <item>it is valid against the tei_all schema : <list>
                        <item>without modification (it is a TEI subset), or </item>
                        <item>after deletion of any elements it contains which are not in the TEI
                           namespace, including their children irrespective of namespace (it is a
                           TEI extension), or </item>
                        <item>after application of any canonicalization algorithm specified by its
                           associated documentation (it is a TEI customized subset); and </item>
                     </list></item>
                  <item>its usage of TEI elements respects the intended function of those elements
                     as defined by the TEI Guidelines; and </item>
                  <item>its usage of the TEI markup scheme is fully described by a TEI-conformant
                     ODD or analogous documentation. </item>
               </list></p>
            <p>The purpose of these rules is to make interchange of documents easier. They do not
               however guarantee it, and they certainly do not provide any guarantee of
               interoperability. Unlike many other standards, the goal of the TEI is not enforce
               consistency of encoding, but to provide a means by which encoding choices and
               policies may be more readily understood, and hence (to some extent) algorithmically
               comparable.</p>
