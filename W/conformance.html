As such, it duplicates to some extent <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/USE.html">an existing chapter of the TEI Guidelines</a>. The reason for producing it is to attempt to establish a consensus about the changes which need to be made in the wording of that chapter, following a number of issues raised on the TEI Issue Tracker (for example <a class="link_ptr" href="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1586"><span>https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1586</span></a> and <a class="link_ptr" href="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1587"><span>https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1587</span></a></p><p>It seems helpful to begin with a little picture: </p><div class="figure"><img src="media/oddflavours.png" alt="" class="graphic" /></div><p>Each of the blobs here represents three subtly different things: </p><ul><li class="item">an ODD : that is, a collection of TEI specifications</li><li class="item">a formal schema generated from that ODD, and its natural language documentation</li><li class="item">the set of documents considered valid by that schema</li></ul><p>The TEI provides tei_all : a set of over 500 uniquely identifiable elements, classes, attributes, etc. and a schema in which they are all permitted. For all practical purposes a user of the TEI must make a selection from this cornucopia, and we call that selection a <span class="term">TEI subset</span>. Of course there are many many possible TEI subsets, each making different choices of elements or attributes or classes, but the sets of documents which each consequent schema will validate all have in common that they will also be considered valid by the schema tei_all.</p><p>A user of the TEI may however do more than simply choose a subset of the provided specifications. They may also provide additional constraints for aspects of an encoding left underspecified by the TEI, for example by requiring that attribute values be taken from a closed list of possible values rather than being any syntactically valid token. They may change the datatype of an attribute, for example from a string to an integer or a date. They may provide an alternative identifier for an element or an attribute, for example to change its canonical English name for one from another language. They may change the content model of an element, for example so that child elements may appear in an order different from that specified by the TEI. They may change the class memberships of an existing TEI element, for example so that it gains attributes not expected by the existing element, or so that it may appear in different contexts.</p><p>In some cases, these modifications result in a schema which continues to regard as valid a subset of the documents considered valid by tei_all. In others this is not the case. Renaming operations, for example, cannot ever result in a subset: a document in which the element names have all been changed to their French equivalents cannot be validated by an English language version of tei_all. A change to the content model or the class memberships of existing TEI elements may or may not be equivalent to a subsetting operation. For example, if the order of child elements within some element is changed from unspecified to specified, the resulting schema will still be a subset of tei_all; the reverse is not the case, as some documents considered valid by the new schema will be considered invalid by tei_all. </p><p>We use the term <span class="term">customised subset</span> for all these kinds of personalisation because they result in something which is not necessarily a further subset of the TEI subset concerned, but a further modification of it. In the general case, their conformance with tei_all can be determined only by inspection, and their validation may require some additional processing.</p><p>Finally, a user of the TEI is at liberty to define entirely new elements and attributes, and to make such components members of existing TEI classes so that existing TEI elements may refer to them. They may also modify the content models of existing TEI elements to refer explicitly to such new elements. This results in an <span class="term">extended subset</span>, since it contains elements or attributes additional to those provided by the tei_all schema. Such additional components should always be labelled as belonging to a non-TEI namespace. A processor can then determine that these components may be left out of consideration when determining the validity of a document with respect to tei_all.</p><p>In additional to these formal considerations, TEI conformance involves attention to some less easily verifiable constraints, specifically the twin requirements of <span class="term">honesty</span> and <span class="term">explicitness</span>. By honesty we mean that elements in the TEI namespace must respect the semantics which the TEI Guidelines supply as a part of their definition. By explicitness we mean that all modifications (i.e. both customized and extended subsets) should be expressed using an ODD to document exactly how the TEI declarations on which they are based have been derived. (An ODD need not of course be based on the TEI at all, but in that case the question of TEI conformance does not arise)</p><p>Formally speaking, we can say of a document that it is <span class="term">TEI conformant</span> if : </p><ul><li class="item">it is a well formed XML document; and </li><li class="item">it is valid against the tei_all schema : <ul><li class="item">without modification (it is a TEI subset), or </li><li class="item">after deletion of any elements it contains which are not in the TEI namespace, including their children irrespective of namespace (it is a TEI extension), or </li><li class="item">after application of any canonicalization algorithm specified by its associated documentation (it is a TEI customized subset); and </li></ul></li><li class="item">its usage of TEI elements respects the intended function of those elements as defined by the TEI Guidelines; and </li><li class="item">its usage of the TEI markup scheme is fully described by a TEI-conformant ODD or analogous documentation. </li></ul><p>The purpose of these rules is to make interchange of documents easier. They do not however guarantee it, and they certainly do not provide any guarantee of interoperability. Unlike many other standards, the goal of the TEI is not enforce consistency of encoding, but to provide a means by which encoding choices and policies may be more readily understood, and hence (to some extent) algorithmically comparable.</p></div><!--TEI back--><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Lou Burnard.
