## Notes towards an autobiography
 You don't want to believe everything you read about me [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Burnard). But there are some 
mostly truthful autobiographical notes [here](https://lb42.github.com/Diary/index.html). And my most recently tidied CV is [readable here](W/cv6.html)

## Bibliography
 [This page](W/operaOmnia.html) lists everything written by me which has appeared 
 in print, with links to online versions of various kinds where possible.  Some of these
are probably infringing copyright.

## Reports from the Vault
[This page](W/collectedReports.html) collects reports on various events I attended between 1977 and 2002, 
  mostly written because I had to submit a report to get my expenses reimbursed. Some of them are probably libellous.

 - [Through Beatnik Eyeballs](W/beatnikEyeballs.html) TEI edition of a strange pulp novel from the early 1960s.
