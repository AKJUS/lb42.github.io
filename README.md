## Notes towards an autobiography
 You don't want to believe everything you read [about me on Wikipedia](). But there are some 
mostly true autobiographical notes on [this page]


## Reports from the Vault
[This page](W/collectedReports.html) collects reports on various events I attended between 1977 and 2002, 
  mostly written because I had to submit a report to get my expenses reiumbursed. Some of them are probably libellous.
  
  
## Bibliography
 [This page](W/operaOmnia.html) lists everything written by me which has appeared 
 in print, with links to online versions of various kinds where possible.  Some of these
are probably infringing copyright.
