The nearest towns are Bussiere Dunoise, about 1 km North, and St Vaury about 6 km South. The nearest usable rail links are Gueret, about 20 km to the South East, and La Souterraine, about 35 km to the West. The nearest airport is Limoges, about 90 km to the South West.</p><p><a class="link_ref" href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@46.2410803,1.7730118,14z?hl=en">click here for a google map</a></p><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">By car</span></h2><p>I wouldn't contemplate it myself, but I know people who have driven here from the UK. If you do motorways, you will probably want to take the A20 autoroute as far as La Souterraine, and then take the N145 East as far as St Vaury. </p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">By air</span></h2><p>There are cheap flights to Limoges from several UK airports during the summer (see <a class="link_ref" href="http://skyscanner.net/transport/flights/uk/lig/cheapest-flights-from-united-kingdom-to-limoges.html?adults=1&amp;oym=1605">SkyScanner for May</a>) most of them from Stansted with <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en/timetable">Ryanair</a>, but there's also a daily flight from Southampton, with Flybe. There are also a few direct flights within France (e.g. to Lyon with <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.chalair.eu/index.php/en/flight-schedules">Chalair</a>) and frequent but expensive flights to Paris. If you arrive at Limoges airport, your best bet is to pick up a hire car there. Otherwise, it's a 25 euro, 25 minute, taxi ride to the magnificent Gare de Limoges Benedictine. No there isn't a bus.</p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">By rail or bus</span></h2><p>The (fairly) high speed <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.sncf.com/fr/trains/intercites/lignes-jour/paris-austerlitz-limoges-toulouse-cerbere">intercité service between Paris and Toulouse</a> occasionally stops at La Souterraine, where it connects with a <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.creuse.fr/pdf_horaires/LigneN9.pdf">bus to Gueret</a>, which also stops in St Vaury. I usually take that route, phoning for a taxi from St Vaury (05 55 80 29 41 or 05 55 80 26 79) well in advance. From Limoges there are <a class="link_ref" href="http://cdn.ter.sncf.com/medias/PDF/limousin/FH_L10_%2013_12_%202015_au_10_12_2016_MAJ_%2014_12_2015_tcm61-67264_tcm61-67263.pdf">occasional trains to Gueret, continuing to Montlucon</a>, which is handy if you are coming from the South East of France; there is also a route <a class="link_ref" href="http://cdn.ter.sncf.com/medias/PDF/limousin/FH_L4_du_13_12_2015_au_10_12_2016_tcm61-65998_tcm61-65961.pdf">from Limoges via Perigueux to the South West</a>. For an overview of local train services see <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.ter.sncf.com/limousin/depliant/recherche">TER limousin</a>; for buses see <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.creuse.fr/spip.php?article1301">Creuse Bus</a>. <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.captaintrain.com/search/">Captain Train</a> is my preferred train ticket vendor. Sozzrington for stating the obvious</p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">By TAD</span></h2><p>Weekday mornings, there is a regular bus from Bussiere to Gueret, which leaves at 0845, but does not appear to come back. Much more useful is the <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.agglo-grandgueret.fr/les-navettes-du-grand-gueret-en-transport-la-demande">Transports-a-la-demande</a> service, which runs there and back thrice a day (but not sundays). You have to book your ride before 5 pm the day before you want to travel and you also have to register to use the service.</p></div><!--TEI back--><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Date: 2016-03-08<br /><!--
